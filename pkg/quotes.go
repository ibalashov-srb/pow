	1: "Never break your promises. Keep every promise; it makes you credible.",
	2: "You are never as stuck as you think you are. Success is not final, and failure isn’t fatal.",
	3: "Happiness is a choice. For every minute you are angry, you lose 60 seconds of your own happiness.",
	4: "Habits develop into character. Character is the result of our mental attitude and the way we spend our time.",
	5: "Be happy with who you are. Being happy doesn’t mean everything is perfect but that you have decided to look beyond the imperfections.",
	6: "Don’t seek happiness–create it. You don’t need life to go your way to be happy.",
	7: "If you want to be happy, stop complaining. If you want happiness, stop complaining about how your life isn’t what you want and make it into what you do want.",
	8: "Asking for help is a sign of strength. Don’t let your fear of being judged stop you from asking for help when you need it. Sometimes asking for help is the bravest move you can make. You don’t have to go it alone.",
	9: "Replace every negative thought with a positive one. A positive mind is stronger than a negative thought.",
